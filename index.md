<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/computer-science/index.aspx" target="_blank">School of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx" target="_blank"> University of Birmingham </a>, where I am delving into the field of software system optimization. Under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://ideas-labo.github.io/" target = "_blank">Tao Chen</a> and Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/miqing-li" target="_blank">Miqing Li</a>, I am dedicated to developing cutting-edge multifidelity configuration tuning algorithms, specifically designed to enhance the performance of expensive optimization processes within software systems.

I embarked on my academic journey in Evolutionary Computation at <a href="https://en.szu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Shenzhen University</a>, mentored by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=87XNTVsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN" target="_blank">Qiuzhen Lin</a> during my masterâ€™s studies in Computer Technology. This pursuit built upon my undergraduate work in Information Management and Information System at <a href="https://www.gdou.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Guangdong Ocean University</a>, laying the foundation for my current research endeavors.
